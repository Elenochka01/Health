### Health  
---  
### Project Description  
This project features a Selenium automation script developed in Java to validate the functionality of a web-based healthcare application.  

- The script ensures that critical UI elements are present and interactable across multiple pages.  
- It automates key workflows, such as navigating through sections and interacting with form fields.  
- The **Locators** class has been introduced to centralize element identification, improving maintainability and reducing redundancy. This class contains well-structured locators for various elements used throughout the test cases.  
- The `Thread.sleep` method is used solely for visual validation to make each step clearly visible in the recorded video. The test execution video is also attached for referenceâ€”please check it out.
